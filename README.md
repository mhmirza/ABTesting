# ABTesting

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **A/B Testing Design & Implementation**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. To view my GitHub repository, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/ABTesting). The work done here involves fundamentals of randomized control trials (a.k.a. A/B tests), namely what they achieve, how to design, implement and analyze their outcomes as well as their shortcomings and work arounds. The assignments and project completed below also leverage the tools that can be used to analyze data from observational studies where randomization can not be implemented. The course uses examples with real-world datasets drawn from research performed at the Heinz College in entertainment and education.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, A/B Testing Design & Implementation, I wish to garner an understanding of causality and the appropriate language to ask and answer causal questions. In addition to the theoretical knowledge, I intend to learn how the intuition is developed for implementation using fundamental tools required to measure causal effects. The following concepts have been covered in the assignments below: _Randomized Control Experiments; Time and Individual Fixed Effects; Instrumental Variables; Natural Experiments; Differences in Differences; Propensity Score Matching; Compliance in Experiments; Heterogeneous Effects; Interference in Networked Experiments._

# Final Project

Brief Description: The final project (to be updated) delves into exploratory analysis and building predictive models using the Yelp academic dataset. We will explore machine learning tasks in the context of a real-world data set using big data analysis tools. It contains the following parts:

Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Part 2: Prediction using tree ensemble methods
Part 3: Collaborative filtering for recommendation
Part 4: Topic modeling for text reviews
Part 5: Word2Vec for text reviews
